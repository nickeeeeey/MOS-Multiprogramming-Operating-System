This project involves the development of a multiprogramming operating system with two distinct phases. In Phase I, a basic system initialization is achieved, encompassing bootloader creation, memory management, process control block implementation, and fundamental system calls. Phase II builds upon this foundation, introducing advanced multiprogramming features such as enhanced process scheduling, a basic file system, interprocess communication mechanisms, and additional device drivers.
